                <h3>Desi Tips</h3>
                  <p>
                    Traditional desi food seems to be made less and less by younger generations.
                    For many amateur cooks, one of the reasons is that the process from start to finish can be a very daunting one.
                    Indian food can be easy, quick and healthy if the proper method is adopted. After a few tips are mastered, the options of
                     making sabjis (Indian vegetable based dishes) and curries are endless.
                      Masala acts as the base flavour of each dish you attempt, so it is essential to get the cooking of these right.
                       Once our tips are put into action, there’s honestly no stopping the Desi Chef in you!</p>
